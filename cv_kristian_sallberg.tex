        {Software Engineer}
        {Cisco Systems AB}
        {Stockholm}
        {}{
Working within a group responsible for network configuration and
automation. Using our products ConfD and NSO, customers can
speed up deployment of network services and decrease OPEX.
I am part of the team responsible for an auto generated Command Line Interface.
Customers write YANG models to define what their CLI will look like.
In addition to this, I work on maintaining and extending a YANG compiler.
I use Erlang/OTP.

        {Stockholm}
        {}{
Titled \textit{``A Data Model Driven Approach to Managing Network Functions
  Virtualization''}.
I developed a driver to enable a network configuration system (ConfD)
to virtualize VMs, on top of libvirt. Using this driver,
it is possible to launch and configure Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).
VNFs allow network operators to implement network services faster.
As a part of the work, I evaluated alternative approaches and compared
them to the master thesis' solution.
